How to use OpenGeode-IO file formats
====================================

This page explains how to be able to use OpenGeode file formats in your code.

What to do?
===========

You just have to add in your executable/code depending on your needs:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	initialize_mesh_io();

and/or

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	initialize_model_io();

These functions are declared in the files ``:ref:`include/geode/mesh/detail/common.h <doxid-mesh_2detail_2common_8h_source>``` and ``include/geode/model/representation/detail/common.h``. Do not forget to include the right file in your code.

You have examples in the OpenGeode-IO tests.

Why I have to do that?
======================

The reason is quite simple. Have a quick look at the file ``OpenGeode-IO/src/geode/mesh/common.cpp``.

In this file you can see that supported file formats for meshes are registered when the ``OpenGeode-IO_mesh`` library is loaded. But the I/O code is not directly called in executable (see tests for examples), and as a consequence the ``OpenGeode-IO_mesh`` library is not loaded. This is called the lazy loading of dependencies.

If you call the function ``initialize_mesh_io()``, the library is loaded, the file formats are registered and you are able to use :ref:`our supported file formats <doxid-opengeode_io_supported_file_formats>`.
